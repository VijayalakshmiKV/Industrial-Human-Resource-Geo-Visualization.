This project is all about understanding where and how people work in India’s industrial sector. We look at different industries, states, and districts, and study how workers are distributed based on gender and rural vs urban areas.

The goal is to turn raw census-style data into meaningful insights that anyone can understand.

* Why This Project?

India has a huge and diverse workforce, but the data around it is often complex and difficult to interpret. This project helps to:

Understand workforce patterns across states

Compare main vs marginal workers

See gender participation in different industries

Identify rural and urban employment trends

All of this is presented in a clean and visual way.

* Tools & Technologies Used

Python – for data cleaning and analysis

Pandas & NumPy – for handling and transforming data

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – for step-by-step analysis

Streamlit – for building an interactive dashboard

*Project Workflow

Data Loading – Import raw data files

Data Cleaning – Rename columns, remove errors, check missing values

Feature Engineering – Create total workers, gender totals, rural/urban totals

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Find patterns and trends

Final Dataset Creation – Save a clean CSV file

Dashboard Creation – Visualize insights using Streamlit# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization.
This project explores how India’s industrial workforce is distributed across states and industries. It analyzes main and marginal workers by gender and rural–urban areas, and presents insights through simple visualizations and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to support better workforce planning.
